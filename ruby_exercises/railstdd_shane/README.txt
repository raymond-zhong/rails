README

- Over the past week and a half, I have noticed that a lot of you have been referencing my video lectures quite a lot in order to do the assignments. I figured it would be helpful for you guys to have a text version for you to more easily reference the syntax and explanations in a readable form, so I have put together these pdf notes. These notes are an expanded version of the lecture, and are all the things that I would include if I wanted to do like a 4 hour lecture.
- These pdf notes cover the same material as the platform. You are free to go through either the platform or these notes, or both, they will get you to the same place. In the interest of time I would recommend that you use these notes, because I think they work well in junction with the lecture I am going to give today and also the lecture I gave on rubyTDD last week.
